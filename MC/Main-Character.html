            <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
            <p>Harry Potter was prophesied to be the downfall of Lord Voldemort and therefore singled out at birth as the Dark Lord's rival. He was known in the wizarding world as 'The Boy Who Lived' after becoming the only known survivor of the Killing Curse, which was attempted by Voldemort when Harry was just a baby, after both his parents were murdered. But despite causing one of the most famous wizarding world events, Harry did not know he was a wizard until his eleventh birthday, due to his Muggle aunt and uncle neglecting to tell him. He would eventually go on to Hogwarts, discover his magical potential, and embark upon several great adventures with his best friends, Ron and Hermione.</p>

            <h2>Ron Weasley</h2>
            <p>Ron Weasley was Harry's, and Hermione's, best friend. Fiery haired and headed, Ron was the second youngest of the seven Weasley children. Used to hand-me-downs, from robes to rats, Ron’s friendship with Harry often came under pressure as he tried to deal with living in the shadow of his best friend. However, there was more to Ron than his red hair and broken wand. Ron might not have Hermione’s brains or Harry’s fame, but his loyalty, bravery and selflessness make him an important part of the trio.</p>

Though incredibly clever, she proved herself a true Gryffindor time and time again, using her courage as well as problem-solving skills in the face of danger, proving vital in the struggle against Lord Voldemort. As Hermione says herself: “Books! And cleverness! There are more important things - friendship and bravery..."</p>

            <p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was Headmaster of Hogwarts and the founder of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to defeating Lord Voldemort. With a penchant for Muggle sweets and a beard long enough to be tucked into his belt, Dumbledore's quirky exterior should not be taken too lightly, for there was nothing that got past this great wizard. Dumbledore was a father figure for Harry Potter, and known to be the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared.</p>

            <h2>Lord Voldemort</h2>
            <p>Born Tom Marvolo Riddle, Lord Voldemort or He-Who-Must-Not-be-Named was one of the most powerful Dark wizards of all time. His closest followers, the Death Eaters, were dedicated to establishing a new Voldemort-led supremacy, but were forced into hiding after their leader was mysteriously vanquished when he tried to kill a defenceless infant - a young Harry Potter. Little did anyone know, however, that Voldemort had gone further than any other wizard in his pursuit of immortality, and he would return once more.</p>
